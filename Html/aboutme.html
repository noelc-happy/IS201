        <p> I've painted since I was around 6 years old and always dreamed to do paintings for my church! </p>

         <p class="box1">I paint because it allows me to <span class="bold">express</span> feelings and thoughts that words often fail to capture. 
        There’s something deeply grounding and healing about putting brush to canvas—watching colors 
        blend, forms take shape, and emotions find a voice. Painting helps me slow down, reflect, and 
        connect more deeply with the beauty of the world around me. It’s a space where I feel free to 
        be creative, honest, and intentional. Each piece I create holds a part of me—my faith, my memories, 
        and my hope to uplift others through something visual and lasting.</p>
         <p class="box1 box2">Painting has always been a part of me—something I’ve loved since I was a child. 
        Growing up surrounded by nature and open spaces, I found endless inspiration in the world around me: 
        the way light moves through trees, the colors of the sky at sunset, or the quiet stillness of early 
        mornings. Art became my way of capturing those moments and holding onto them. Over time, it’s become 
        more than just a hobby; it’s a form of worship, a way to honor the beauty God has created and share it 
        with others in a personal, meaningful way.</p>
         <p class="box1 box2 box3">I also paint because I want to make an impact. In a world that often feels 
        rushed, divided, or distracted, I believe art can remind people to slow down and feel again—to notice,
         to wonder, and to heal. Whether I’m painting a landscape, a person, or something abstract, my hope is 
         always the same: that someone might look at it and feel seen, inspired, or comforted. Painting allows 
         me to connect with people without needing to say a word, and that quiet power is what keeps me coming 
         back to the canvas again and again.</p>

                    <li>Joy</li>
